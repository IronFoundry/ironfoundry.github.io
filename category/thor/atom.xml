     <p>We’ve heard a great, positive response to the <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/2013/08/10/manage-cloud-foundry-from-osx-with-thor/" target="_blank">release of Thor</a>, and we’ve started work on Thor v2 which will be compliant with Cloud Foundry v2 environments. We’re also getting going on Thor.NET so that Windows developers can also get in on the Cloud Foundry fun.</p>




<p>For Thor v2, we’re going to update the user flow to better reflect the structural changes in Cloud Foundry v2. Specifically, we want to represent the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/orgs-and-spaces.html" target="_blank">Organizations and Spaces</a> in Thor, and make it easy to assign users to roles in both. You’ll be able to add references to multiple clouds, list the spaces in an organization, view the applications within a space, and view the details for a given app. Some of our first UI sketches show off this model.</p>




<p><img src="/img/blog/2013-08-23-1_org_space_app_view-sml.png" /></p>




<p>Adding users and assigning them to roles will be simple.</p>




<p><img src="/img/blog/2013-08-23-3_org_users-sml.png" /></p>




<p>We’ve already begun doing the formal mockups for the Thor UI (that will look the same for both Thor and Thor.NET) and will be diving into core development shortly.</p>




<p><img src="/img/blog/2013-08-29_space_overview.png" /></p>




<p>We’d love to have you contribute to either project! The Thor v2 for OSX project is <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>. The Thor.NET project has a <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET" target="_blank">basic skeleton in GitHub</a> and we’ll be rolling on that shortly. Questions? Feature ideas? Throw something into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry forums</a>.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[
     <p>We're excited to announce that a stable release of the OSS Thor client is ready to go! Thor is a OSX client tool for managing <strong>ANY</strong> Cloud Foundry v1 environment. You can <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor" target="_blank">view (and contribute!) to the source code</a>, or download a ready-to-use, <a href="http://app.ironfoundry.me/download/get/28745936-f900-e211-9f38-00505696004e" target="_blank">compiled version</a>.</p>

<p>Thor was built to support developers who deploy applications to Cloud Foundry. With Thor you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Add target clouds. </strong>Point to any Cloud Foundry v1-compliant endpoint to begin managing applications. 

<img title="Thor2" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor2" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor2.png" width="400" height="200" /> </li>

	<li><strong>View target cloud statistics, deployments. </strong>For any target cloud, you can see the number of running applications, memory consumption, and storage used. You can also see each deployed application and available services. 

<br /><img title="Thor4" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor4" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor4.png" width="400" height="318" /> </li>

	<li><strong>Add applications. </strong>Reference applications that reside on your machine and push them to multiple clouds. 

<br /><img title="Thor5" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor5" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor5.png" width="400" height="318" /> </li>

	<li><strong>Deploy and update applications. </strong>For each local application added to Thor, you can choose which cloud to publish it to. 

<br /><img title="Thor7" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor7" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor7.png" width="400" height="205" /> </li>

	<li><strong>Create services. </strong>Create instances of Cloud Foundry services (e.g. MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ) to associate with your application. 

<br /><img title="Thor10" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor10" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor10.png" width="400" height="252" /> </li>

	<li><strong>Bind services to applications. </strong>Create a linkage between a given service and application. 

<br /><img title="Thor12" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor12" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor12.png" width="400" height="252" /> </li>

	<li><strong>Manage running applications. </strong>You can start, restart, or stop a given application, see its usage statistics, and change its resource application. 

<br /><img title="Thor13" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="Thor13" src="/img/blog/2013_08_09-Thor13.png" width="400" height="318" /> </li>
</ul>

<p>What's next? The Iron Foundry team is already hard at work on Thor v2 which will be compliant with new Cloud Foundry v2 environments. We’ll also be shipping a version of Thor v2 for Windows developers. Want to be involved? Let us know and start contributing to the fun open source ecosystem of Cloud Foundry tools.</p>

<p>A number of folks were instrumental in planning, building, testing, and packaging this release. Props to team members <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanyoung" target="_blank">Nathan Young</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottdensmore" target="_blank">Scott Densmore</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shanturoy" target="_blank">Shantu Roy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adron" target="_blank">Adron Hall</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bvanderveen" target="_blank">Benjamin van der Veen</a>!</p>

  <title>Windows 8 & RT Discussions, Thor, Thor .NET and vcap-client Status Updates</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/10/30/thor-thor-net-and-vcap-client-status-updates/</link>

  <description><![CDATA[
     A few updates from the teams:
<h2>Thor</h2>
<p>Thor is moving along with implementation of services starting yesterday (Monday). You can view our live <a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/Thor/board" target="_blank">Huboard Kanban</a> to see what is currently being worked on. The interface in the last few weeks has gotten a faster, cleaner appearance and stabilized even more around deploying and maintaining your Cloud Foundry based environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/"><img src="http://adronhall.smugmug.com/Software/Software-Development/Thor/i-fQFJCBP/0/S/square-S.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>If you're an XCode user and familiar with Git, check out the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> to pull down the latest code and try it out yourself against your own Cloud Foundry Projects - private or public hosted!</p>

<h2>Thor .NET for Windows Users</h2>
<p>The Windows version of the Thor Client is about to go into beta in the coming weeks. It has an elegant metro style interface and will initially be available for Windows 7.</p>

<p>For the WinRT and Windows 8 versions we're still determining what the best approach is to development of this version of the UI. We'd love any additional input on the WinRT or Windows 8 Applications or how you see you may use the application on WinRT or Windows 8. Let us know in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/bJJucnSx1Vc" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a>.</p>
<h2>vcap-client on Nuget</h2>
<p>Recently we released the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-client" target="_blank">vcap-client library</a> for client usage against any <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> and <a href="http://ironfoundry.org" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a> Built Environments. So if you're a use of the .NET Framework, this library has all the functionality wrapped up in a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">Nuget Package</a> for you.</p>

<p>So if you're a user of <a href="http://www.appfog.com" target="_blank">AppFog</a>, <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com" target="_blank">CloudFoundry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tier3.com/services/fabric" target="_blank">Tier 3 Web Fabric</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato</a> or another Cloud Foundry enabled environment and write code against the .NET Framework, this is a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">great library</a> to try out.</p>
<h2>Conversations Around Iron Foundry Library</h2>
<p>We're currently having conversations via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a> for implementing <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/qa2c9S88r_o" target="_blank">background services for .NET</a>. Join the conversation if you'd like to contribute, add your suggestions or have any ideas on how this should be implemented.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[
     Today we're releasing the alpha Thor Applications with installers for Mac OS-X and a partial Windows 7 release. We wanted to get minimally viable products out the door as soon as possible so people could check out our progress and work we've accomplished for the Thor User Interfaces with Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry Environments! So here they are. Here's a few screen shots to how we're doing...

[caption id="attachment_145" align="aligncenter" width="816"]<a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/09/alpha-for-thor-download-try-get-involved/004-thor-running/" rel="attachment wp-att-145"><img class="size-full wp-image-145" title="Thor Running on OS-X" src="/img/blog/004-Thor-Running.jpg" alt="Thor Running on OS-X" width="816" height="802" /></a> Thor Running on OS-X[/caption]

[caption id="attachment_144" align="aligncenter" width="707"]<a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/09/alpha-for-thor-download-try-get-involved/003-add-a-cloud/" rel="attachment wp-att-144"><img class="size-full wp-image-144" title="Adding a Cloud Foundry Target" src="/img/blog/003-Add-a-Cloud.png" alt="Adding a Cloud Foundry Target" width="707" height="595" /></a> Adding a Cloud Foundry Target[/caption]

To download the Thor OS-X and Windows 7 installer releases check out the <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">downloads</a> page. We'll be iterating on the code base regularly still, so if you know github well I'd suggest going to clone the code itself and running it. The installers are still however a working option to check it out.
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<strong>What's Being Worked On?</strong>

The workflow we're using for Thor &amp; Thor .NET is viewable via the issues section on Github and also for a good kanban visualization we're using <a href="http://huboard.com" target="_blank">Huboard</a>. For each of the projects we've started or are starting a Hubaord Kanban.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/Thor/board" target="_blank">Thor</a> on <a href="http://bit.ly/UfGdXC" target="_blank">Github</a> (OS-X Version) and the respective <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor/issues?milestone=4&amp;state=open" target="_blank">issues, stories and more</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET/board" target="_blank">Thor .NET</a> on <a href="http://bit.ly/SugiK9" target="_blank">Github</a> (Win 7 Version) and the respective <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET/issues?state=open" target="_blank">issues, stories and more</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry/board" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a> (Core Iron Foundry .NET Support &amp; Libraries for extending Cloud Foundry)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Getting the Code</strong>

To clone/fork/download the latest code to work with, contribute, and send pull requests with follow these steps.
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the main source and fork the code.</li>
	<li>Once you've forked the code, navigate to your repository and clone to your local development machine.</li>
</ol>
<code>git clone git@github.com:YourGithubAccount/Thor.git</code>
<ol>
	<li>Once the clone is complete, for the OS-X version you'll need to pull the submodules with the following command. For the Windows 7 version just do a clone and build.</li>
</ol>
<code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>

Your local repository should have executable code now. Open the project with XCode or Visual Studio 2010, depending on which project you're checking out and see if everything works. If it doesn't, please post a comment to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">discussion list</a> or message us via Twitter on <a href="http://twitter.com/ironfoundryorg" target="_blank">@ironfoundryorg</a>.

<strong>Working on the Code</strong>

Once you've added the feature, or completed one of the stories or items in the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor/issues?state=open">Thor issues list</a> or <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET/issues?state=open" target="_blank">Thor .NET issues list</a> leave a comment on the issue and submit a pull request (or just submit the pull request). We'll then merge it back in, or if there are conflicts we'll work with you to merge it back in and add the code to master.

  <description><![CDATA[
     The Iron Foundry project has had an amazing nine months since its launch. Thank you to the entire community for your support and contributions.

With over 3500 downloads and 500 active developers using the free Iron Foundry.ME trial environment, the project has exceeded our expectations.
First, the Iron Foundry team released some powerful tools to support the community including
• Soon after launch we added the NET DEA.
• In February we enabled local development for .NET community with the Micro Iron Foundry
• In April we released the Iron Foundry .ME Environment enabling full Cloud Foundry support + .NET in a free test environment. In addition, we expanded database support to MySQL and Postgres and added support for Rabbit MQ.
• In August we issued an update to the Iron Foundry VMC to keep it in synch with Cloud Foundry.

And, we are very excited not only about the continuing evolution of the available tools, but also the momentum in the industry around Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry adoption. Among the many highlights:
• Intel -- one of the world’s best IT shops -- recently revealed that they are running Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry as their internal environment
• The team at Active announced full Stackato integration with Iron Foundry
• New Zealand’s Appsecute launched their Cloud Foundry application management service with support for managing Iron Foundry applications.

Today we are excited to give you a sneak peak at something special the team has been working on we’ll release to the community in September: Project Thor.

Thor -- and its brother Thor.NET -- is the new client tool for managing your Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry environments from the desktop.  Thor is the OS-X version and Thor.NET is the Windows version. To grab a sneak peak of the UI and to read our thoughts around design, architecture, and our belief in community for these tools go to <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/thor">http://www.ironfoundry.org/thor</a>.
