# Getting a Beta Account
*(Note that will be automating this process as quickly as we can)*

Users wishing to create an account on ironfoundry.me can submit their request using the [Sign Up](http://app.ironfoundry.me/signup) above. They will need to provide their email address, the desired name for their organization ([more about organizations and spaces here](/help/orgs-and-spaces.html)), and agree to the Terms and Conditions of the site. This will send a request for a new account to the Iron Foundry team, who will process it as quickly as possible. Automating this process is one of our short term goals, but it was not part of the original Minimal Viable Product needed to field ironfoundry.me.

The requestor will receive an email back containing information about their new account, including:

* Instructions for how to log in for the first time and how to change their password
* Directions on how to add additional people to their account, asking for the email address, and a list of the organizational roles and/or the spaces and space roles that the user should have.
* A description of the services available in our marketplace
* Links to various help resources, both on Iron Foundry and on Cloud Foundry.

Each person invited to share the organizational account will receive a similar email.
