# Setup A Local Dev Environment

Here are some of your options for setting up a local V2 Cloud Foundry environment:

* Vagrant - using the [Altoros CF Vagrant installer project](https://github.com/Altoros/cf-vagrant-installer). This is how the Iron Foundry team got their V2 environments set up. We also contributed VMware Workstation support back to this project.
* BOSH - using the [cf-release repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release). Not for the faint of heart.
* Nise-BOSH - an intriguing alternative to Vagrant [https://github.com/nttlabs/nise_bosh](https://github.com/nttlabs/nise_bosh)
