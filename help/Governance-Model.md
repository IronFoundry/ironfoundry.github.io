# CloudFoundry Governance
This project is led and managed by a benevolent dictator. That is, the benevolent dictator is responsible for the general strategic direction in addition to the day-to-day maintenance of the project. In turn, it is the community’s job to guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and contribution.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Benevolent dictator (project leads)
In the IronFoundry project the role of Benevolent Dictator (project lead(s)) is Jared Wray. However, because the community always has the ability to fork, they are fully answerable to the community. The project lead(s) are expected to understand the community as a whole and strive to satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project survives in the long term.

In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictator is less about dictatorship and more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the vision of the project leads.

The project lead(s) is the primary point of contact or first point of contact for the project for purposes of business operations including domain registrations, and technical services (e.g. code-signing).

#### Committers

Committers are contributors who have made sustained valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository. In many cases they are programmers but it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the project lead. The role of committer is not an official one; it is simply a position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as the project lead looks to them for guidance and support.

Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However, they do have the ear of the project lead(s). It is a committer’s job to ensure that the lead is aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often, committers are given informal control over their specific areas of responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the source code. That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the decisions made by the leads.
**How to become one:** Be appointed by the Benevolent Dictator

#### Contributors
Contributors are community members who submit pull requests for the project. These pull requests may be a one-time occurrence or occur over time. Expectations are that contributors will submit pull requests that are small at first and will only grow larger once the contributor has built confidence in the quality of their pull requests.

**Note:** Before a contributor’s first pull request is put into the repository they must sign an assignment agreement.
 
* Individual: <http://www.ironfoundry.org/cla-legal/ironfoundry-individual-contributors.pdf>
* Company: <http://www.ironfoundry.org/cla-legal/ironfoudry-company-contributors.pdf>



The pull request can be submitted and discussed but it can’t actually be committed to the repository without the appropriate paperwork in place.

**How to become one:** Submit a pull request. We'll evaluate the request to determine if it aligns with the projects goals. In addition to the goal alignment there is also a requirement to include appropriate tests and these tests run without failure. If all of the requirements are met we’ll accept it and merge it into the project. 

#### Users
Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

* Advocating the use of the project
* Informing developers of the project strength and weaknesses from a new user’s perspective
* Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
* Writing documentation and tutorials
* Filing bug reports and feature requests
* Participating on the discussion board

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.

<!--# Governance Model

Today we are sharing more information on the Iron Foundry governance model.

Anybody who believes in enabling the .NET ecosystem into the Cloud Foundry platform and who wants to contribute or help build the community is more than welcome to participate or contribute to Iron Foundry.

While Tier 3 is the lead on the project and will remain a strong active voice, we welcome contributors and sponsors to take an active role In the Iron Foundry project.  This effort will in turn  be recognized:  top contributors of the project and sponsors who are active in the community  will be asked to join the governance team.

# How do I get started?

As always the simplest way is to fork the Iron Foundry code on github for simple changes and then issue a pull request to the Iron Foundry team for review. For significant contributions —  as with most open source projects — we do require to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA). The CLA is modeled after the Apache Foundation and Cloud Foundry CLAs, which have worked out well with both communities.
