# Governance Model

Today we are sharing more information on the Iron Foundry governance model.

Anybody who believes in enabling the .NET ecosystem into the Cloud Foundry platform and who wants to contribute or help build the community is more than welcome to participate or contribute to Iron Foundry.

While Tier 3 is the lead on the project and will remain a strong active voice, we welcome contributors and sponsors to take an active role In the Iron Foundry project.  This effort will in turn  be recognized:  top contributors of the project and sponsors who are active in the community  will be asked to join the governance team.

# How do I get started?

As always the simplest way is to fork the Iron Foundry code on github for simple changes and then issue a pull request to the Iron Foundry team for review. For significant contributions —  as with most open source projects — we do require to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA). The CLA is modeled after the Apache Foundation and Cloud Foundry CLAs, which have worked out well with both communities.
