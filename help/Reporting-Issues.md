In order to report issues found while using any of the Iron Foundry projects, you have a couple options:

* This site, via a support ticket.
* Via GitHub issues for the [ironfoundry project](https://github.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry/issues) or for the [dea_ng project](https://github.com/IronFoundry/dea_ng/issues).

Both are good options. If your issue requires work in the code base, it will be closed on this site and migrated to GitHub issues.

Thanks for using and giving feedback on the Iron Foundry project!
