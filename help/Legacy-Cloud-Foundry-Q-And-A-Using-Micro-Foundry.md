# Using Micro Foundry with Iron Foundry

## Question

via Jonathan Adams

Hi Guys

I have the IronFoundry hosted sample working perfectly and now I wish to explore a little further,  I have downloaded the Micro Foundry Virtual Machine from cloudfoundy.com and I have this running on my local machine,  I then installed the .net DEA on my machine setting the host to be the IP address displayed within the virtual machine and the local IP to be 127.0.0.1.

When I opened up Cloud Explorer and point it to my micro cloud everything is validated and works just fine.    Now come the stumbling block,  I created an MVC3 application with no additional code other than the standard template,  in fact its the very same project I used to published to my IronFoundry.org account.

When I try and publish the application ,  if I dont put a url in place it "seems" to complete but doesnt install anything ( i guessed because of the missing url)  so I set the url to be myapp.xxxx.cloudfoundry.me and hit publish this time it seems to get 3/4 or the way throuhg the deploy and then just waits ,  no messages or timeouts or anything.

Now I am assuming I have something not quite configured correctly and wonder if someone could point me in the correct direction.    I have to say though from what I have seen so far excellent work,  I cant wait to get more knowledge under my belt then I hopfully contribute more to this excellent project !!!
