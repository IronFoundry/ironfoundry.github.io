### How Services and Service-Brokers are used in Cloud Foundry
Service brokers are an abstraction provided by Cloud Foundry that encourages loose coupling between an application and the service instances it consumes. Service brokers negotiate the details of the relationship between an application and its services, including the service's actual location, the appropriate credentials to use when accessing it, and limits on how much of the service's resources an application can consume. 

#### The Lifecycle of a Service Broker
Every service broker follows a similar lifetime, involving separate actions by several different roles. Each of these actions, taken together, create the final service broker instance that application developers can consume.

___Adding to the Marketplace___

The Markeplace in Cloud Foundry represents the set of services that are available to be used by developers in creating applications. Developers are only able to see those services that have been configured to be visible for their targeted organization and space. This visibility is configured through the _plan_ defined for that service by the CF administrator - plans can be public and visible to all, or private, which gives a service limited visibility.

A Cloud Foundry administrator must install a service broker into the marketplace. Services are described by their name, a brief description, and a list of the different service plans available for developers. These plans define the cost of using that service, and usually vary from free to increasingly costly and more capable plans. 

Administrators install brokers into the marketplace through the `cf create-service-broker` call. See [Registering a Service Broker](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/services/access-control.html#make-plans-public) and [Service Broker Plans](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/services/access-control.html#make-plans-public) for more details.

___Creating Service Broker Instances___

Before a service can be used in an application, a service broker from the marketplace has to be instantiated. This process creates a new instance of that broker, gives it a name, and constraints it to a single service plan (which describes resource availability, cost, etc).

Organization and Space Managers Service broker instances can be created with `cf create-service` and available service broker instances can be seen through `cf services`.

For example, for this given marketplace

	PS C:\Users\ironfoundry\Desktop> cf marketplace
	Getting services from marketplace in org ironfoundry / space development as ironfoundryorg@gmail.com...
	OK
	
	service   plans   description
	mongodb   free    MongoDB NoSQL database
	ms-sql    free    Microsoft SQL Server Service

we can create another service broker for ms-sql 

	PS C:\Users\ironfoundry\Desktop> cf create-service ms-sql free sample-instance
	Creating service sample-instance in org ironfoundry / space development as ironfoundryorg@gmail.com...
	OK
	
and then view the service broker instances

	PS C:\Users\ironfoundry\Desktop> cf services
	Getting services in org ironfoundry / space development as ironfoundryorg@gmail.com...
	OK
	
	name              service   plan   bound apps
	free-sql          ms-sql    free   
	sample-instance   ms-sql    free

___Binding the Service Broker to an Application___

Once the service broker instance is created, developers are free to use it in their applications. This process is described in
