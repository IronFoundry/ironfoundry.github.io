                    <div class="post-date">
                        Posted in <a href="/blog/category/dea.net">dea.net</a>, <a href="/blog/category/iron foundry">iron foundry</a>, <a href="/blog/category/release">release</a>,  &#183; July 02, 2013
                    </div>
                    <p>The Pivotal team recently made a significant upgrade to Cloud Foundry, changing how applications are <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/architecture/" target="_blank">deployed, staged, isolated, and routed</a>. In order to work with this new model, Iron Foundry had to undergo some re-engineering work. <strong>Today, we’re proud to announce an initial release of a Cloud Foundry v2-compliant build of<a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank"> Iron Foundry</a>.</strong>

The Iron Foundry team has spent some hard-core engineering time building a quality .NET extension to Cloud Foundry. Specifically, we’ve made the following three major updates:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/dea_ng" target="_blank"><strong>Updated .NET DEA</strong></a>. Unlike the previous version of Iron Foundry which included a .NET port of Ruby DEA code, we now use the base Ruby DEA code that is part of Cloud Foundry. It’s been modified slightly to run on Windows, but by reusing the Ruby code, we can more easily stay in sync with improvements introduced by the Cloud Foundry team.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/cloudfoundry-buildpack-clr" target="_blank"><strong>.NET Buildpack</strong></a>. Cloud Foundry v2 <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/deploying-apps/buildpacks.html" target="_blank">makes use of buildpacks</a> to package frameworks and runtimes, and the Iron Foundry team has created a CLR buildpack that supports ASP.NET and (soon) standalone apps.</li>
	<li><a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/running/architecture/warden.html" target="_blank"><strong>.NET Warden.</strong></a> The Warden in Cloud Foundry v2 provides application isolation and resource constraints. It takes advantage of native Linux capabilities and is a key part of the Cloud Foundry framework. We’ve created a Windows-oriented Warden that delivers a secure, isolated container for each application instance. This behavior isn’t natural for a Windows environment, so we’ve been creative in our initial design and are using the IIS web server via the hostable web core vs. the “full” IIS experience. However, we’re considering additional techniques for taking advantage of IIS capabilities (such as application pool recycling) that aren’t present in the hostable web core.</li>
</ul>
Cloud Foundry v2 introduced the <strong>cf tool</strong> that replaced the <strong>vmc tool</strong> that was used for Cloud Foundry v1 management. The <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/cf/index.html" target="_blank">cf interface</a> includes an improved set of capabilities for interrogating, deploying, managing, and configuring Cloud Foundry environments and applications. Now with <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">Iron Foundry v2</a>, you can  use the cf tool against applications running in the .NET DEA! Push applications, scale up, scale down, and do all the things with .NET applications that you do with any other application running in a Cloud Foundry environment.

What’s next?
<ul>
	<li>Today we’re releasing a complete set of instructions for pulling Iron Foundry v2 from its <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry" target="_blank">source on GitHub</a> and building a working environment. Read the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/dea_ng/blob/ironfoundry/WINDOWS.md" target="_blank">DEA installation docs here</a>. We’re also providing an installer for the .NET Warden. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry/blob/master/INSTALL.md" target="_blank">.NET Warden installation docs here</a>. Moving forward, we’re going to be creating a Micro Iron Foundry instance as well as an installer for the new .NET DEA.</li>
	<li>We’re continuing engineering work on the .NET Warden and welcome any contribution from the community! We’re going to continue maturing the isolated, controlled Warden experience on Windows and would love your feedback.</li>
	<li>Any issues you discover with the new DEA <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/dea_ng/issues" target="_blank">can be logged here in GitHub</a>. Any general Iron Foundry issues <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry/issues" target="_blank">should be logged here</a>.</li>
	<li>The public ironfoundry.me sandbox environment is still running Cloud Foundry v1, but we’ll be offering a v2-compliant environment soon!</li>
</ul>
We’re very excited that those running Cloud Foundry v2 environments can now use the best available .NET extension. Want to jump in and help out? Download the code, make changes, and submit a pull request in GitHub!

                    <p><a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">Micro Iron Foundry</a> is a VM image that makes it easy to add the .NET DEA to <a href="https://micro.cloudfoundry.com/" target="_blank">Micro Cloud Foundry</a> development environments. This powerful combination helps developers design their Cloud Foundry solutions locally before pushing to any number of public hosting providers.

Today, we’ve updated the Micro Iron Foundry instance to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Micro Cloud Foundry. Download the VMX or OVF image now and <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/02/iron-foundry-micro-cloud-1-0-0-released/" target="_blank">plug it into your existing Micro Cloud Foundry image</a>. In addition to updating the image to the most recent Cloud Foundry-friendly bits, we’ve also made three other notable changes:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Microsoft .NET 4.5 support.</strong> The latest version of the .NET framework includes a number of cool improvements from Web Sockets support, to better Windows Identity Foundation capabilities, to access to the new ASP.NET Web API. Micro Iron Foundry is running .NET 4.5 and soon you’ll see this support in IronFoundry.ME and other hosting environments.</li>
	<li><strong>DEA compatible with latest ActiveState Stackato. </strong>We’ve ensured that this new Micro Iron Foundry instance works great with the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm" target="_blank">very latest Stackato Micro Cloud</a>. See <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/03/ironfoundry-and-stackato/" target="_blank">our previous blog post</a> on how to connect ActiveState’s great product to a Micro Cloud Foundry + Micro Iron Foundry setup.</li>
	<li><strong>Standard vmc gem works against Iron Foundry applications. </strong>You no longer need to use the vmc-IronFoundry gem in order to push .NET applications to your Iron Foundry DEA in Micro Iron Foundry. Note that you still need this gem when pushing applications to IronFoundry.ME and other Iron Foundry hosting environments.</li>
</ul>
Check it out and let us know if you have any problems!

                    <p>Iron Foundry developers are likely to use a whole host of different IDEs to build and deploy applications. For those building .NET applications, Visual Studio is likely the development environment of choice. Iron Foundry developers can now push and manage apps directly from Visual Studio 2012 using the <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">upgraded Visual Studio Extension</a>.

Now, from either Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2010, developers can push .NET 4.0 apps to any Iron Foundry-compliant endpoint.

                    <div class="post-date">
                        Posted in <a href="/blog/category/how to guide">how to guide</a>, <a href="/blog/category/iron foundry">iron foundry</a>,  &#183; November 08, 2012

                    <p>Iron Foundry and other PaaS frameworks are built to deliver a set of services to developers for building applications. While we think Iron Foundry has a great set of web, data and messaging services available, it by no means includes everything that a developer can use to craft a cool web app. Ideally, a developer can mix and match services from multiple PaaS providers in order to get everything that’s needed to solve a particular problem. For instance, what if an Iron Foundry developer wants to build a .NET application that lets users log in with credentials from a trusted provider? In this blog post, <strong>I’ll show you how to do user authentication/authorization in an Iron Foundry ASP.NET app by using the Windows Azure Access Control Service (ACS)</strong>.
<h3>What is Windows Azure ACS?</h3>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg429786.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Azure ACS</a> is essential a claims transformation engine that connects to trusted web identity providers (e.g. Facebook, Google, Windows Live, Yahoo) and custom identity providers (e.g. through Active Directory Federation Services), and authenticates the user before passing along a set of claims to your web application. It provides developers a way to outsource the identity management part of their application. ACS itself doesn’t store credentials or act as an identity provider, but rather, it acts as a middleman that can take a series of input claims (e.g. “Google username”, “Windows logon ID”) and transform them into a single claim (“user ID”) used by your app. It’s a cool way to get your application out of the business of handling unique identity providers or storing credentials.

Let’s walk through the steps to building a simple, secure web app that we can deploy to Iron Foundry.
<h3>Step 1 - Create new ASP.NET MVC 4 (internet) application</h3>
To get started, I built a new ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio 2012.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp01" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp01.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp01" width="600" height="543" border="0" />

Once the project was created from the MVC4 template, I simply built it and ran it. You can see the default website and notice that I can register for an account. At this point, what this does is store my credentials in the default membership provider (which is a local database). I don’t want that as my long term solution. I want to let users log in with their web identity provider of choice.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp02" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp02.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp02" width="500" height="281" border="0" />

&nbsp;
<h3>2. Configure Access Control Service to Recognize Our Iron Foundry Application</h3>
Virtually every Windows Azure service has migrated from the clunky Silverlight portal to the new, clean HTML portal. Unfortunately, Windows Azure ACS still lives in the old portal. Once I regretfully logged into it, I saw the options to add/configure identity providers, set up the relying party applications (like the one I created), and define the claims transformation rules.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp08" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp08.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp08" width="500" height="403" border="0" />

If I wanted to add ADFS as a valid identity provider, I could do that here. Instead, since I used existing web identity providers, I could jump right to the “relying party applications” section. On the first part of this form, I set the friendly name of the application, and the URL that will receive the claims. Initially (until I deployed to Iron Foundry) this was a local address on my machine.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp09" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp09.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp09" width="450" height="437" border="0" />

Further down this form, I was asked which (configured) identity providers I wished to use, whether or not to create a new set of claims transformation rules, and what certificate to use for signing the tokens.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp10" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp10.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp10" width="300" height="323" border="0" />

After saving my relying party entry, I jumped to the “Rule Groups” section of this portal to configure the transformation rules. I chose the option to “generate rules” for all the available identity providers, and was left with a series of “passthrough” rules that take whatever claim value was issued by the identity provider and ships it, as is, to my application.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp11" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp11.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp11" width="350" height="440" border="0" />

An individual one of these rules, such as the “Google name” one, has an input claim type and value, and an output claim type and value. While the one below has the same type and passthrough value, you can imagine how you might have three different providers with different input claim types/values all map to a single, internally-defined claim type and/or value.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp12" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp12.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp12" width="450" height="490" border="0" />

<h3>3. Configure ASP.NET App to use ACS for Identity Management</h3>
With my ACS configuration complete (for now), I returned to Visual Studio 2012 to make it “ACS aware.” Now there is a great new tool for Visual Studio 2012 and the latest Windows Identification Foundation bits (which you can see by grabbing the <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e21bf653-dfe1-4d81-b3d3-795cb104066e" target="_blank">Identity and Access Tools</a>), but since Iron Foundry doesn’t yet support .NET 4.5, I wasn’t able to use the wizard tooling. The latest WIF only applies to .NET 4.5, so I jumped back to using WIF 3.5. To easily grab this version, simply add the NuGet package for <strong>Windows Identification Foundation</strong>  to a project.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp22" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp22.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp22" width="450" height="257" border="0" />

With all the proper assemblies in place, I then manually updated my web.config file to reflect my use of WIF and ACS. You can find my complete web.config file below. To learn more about the significance of each section, I’d recommend the blog post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/alikl/archive/2010/10/06/windows-identity-foundation-wif-configuration-sections-in-asp-net-web-config.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Identity Foundation (WIF) Configuration Sections in ASP.NET Web.Config</a>.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/4040128.js"> </script>

That’s about it. Clearly if I wanted to customize the handling of these claims (e.g. show the value of a claim besides “name” on the home page), there’s additional work I’d want to do in my code. When I ran this application, I was quickly prompted for credentials and the ACS site served up a page for me to select which identity provider to use.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp14" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp14.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp14" width="450" height="340" border="0" />

When I chose the Google provider, I was redirected to the Google accounts page and asked to log in.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp15" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp15.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp15" width="450" height="262" border="0" />

&nbsp;

Once I logged into my account, I was returned to my custom web app which recognized that I was now authenticated!

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp16" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp16.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp16" width="450" height="396" border="0" />

To prove that this is an account that wasn’t managed by my application itself, I clicked on my name to “manage” my user. I was presented a message indicating that there’s no local password for this user, as the identity provider was NOT my local membership provider.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp17" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp17.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp17" width="450" height="219" border="0" />

&nbsp;
<h3>4. Update and Deploy the App to Iron Foundry Environment</h3>
The final task was to update the ASP.NET application and ACS configurations before deploying the application to Iron Foundry. First, I returned to the Windows Azure ACS portal to change the “realm” of the relying party entry that I created for my custom application. I planned on deploying this application to the <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/signup" target="_blank">free IronFoundry.me</a> environment, so I entered the expected destination of the application.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp18" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp18.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp18" width="450" height="350" border="0" />

After saving this change, I returned to my Visual Studio project and entered that same IronFoundry.me URL into the web.config file where the “localhost” value had been before. After publishing the website to the file system and executing a Cloud Foundry <strong>vmc push</strong> command from my Command console, my app was quickly deployed.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp20" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp20.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp20" width="500" height="253" border="0" />

Did it work? I browsed my newly published app on Iron Foundry, and just as with the local site, I was prompted for which identity provider to use. After selecting Google and plugging in my credentials, I saw my logged in user on the website.

<img style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-width: 0px;" title="2012-11-07-compapp21" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2012-11-07-compapp21.png" alt="2012-11-07-compapp21" width="500" height="489" border="0" />

Cool! This is a fun case of being able to use the public/private Iron Foundry PaaS but still take advantage of other useful services offered by other PaaS solutions.

                    <p>A few updates from the teams:
<h2>Thor</h2>
Thor is moving along with implementation of services starting yesterday (Monday). You can view our live <a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/Thor/board" target="_blank">Huboard Kanban</a> to see what is currently being worked on. The interface in the last few weeks has gotten a faster, cleaner appearance and stabilized even more around deploying and maintaining your Cloud Foundry based environments.

<a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/"><img class="alignright" src="http://adronhall.smugmug.com/Software/Software-Development/Thor/i-fQFJCBP/0/S/square-S.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>If you're an XCode user and familiar with Git, check out the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> to pull down the latest code and try it out yourself against your own Cloud Foundry Projects - private or public hosted!
<h2>Thor .NET for Windows Users</h2>
The Windows version of the Thor Client is about to go into beta in the coming weeks. It has an elegant metro style interface and will initially be available for Windows 7.

For the WinRT and Windows 8 versions we're still determining what the best approach is to development of this version of the UI. We'd love any additional input on the WinRT or Windows 8 Applications or how you see you may use the application on WinRT or Windows 8. Let us know in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/bJJucnSx1Vc" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a>.
<h2>vcap-client on Nuget</h2>
Recently we released the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-client" target="_blank">vcap-client library</a> for client usage against any <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> and <a href="http://ironfoundry.org" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a> Built Environments. So if you're a use of the .NET Framework, this library has all the functionality wrapped up in a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">Nuget Package</a> for you.

So if you're a user of <a href="http://www.appfog.com" target="_blank">AppFog</a>, <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com" target="_blank">CloudFoundry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tier3.com/services/fabric" target="_blank">Tier 3 Web Fabric</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato</a> or another Cloud Foundry enabled environment and write code against the .NET Framework, this is a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">great library</a> to try out.
<h2>Conversations Around Iron Foundry Library</h2>
We're currently having conversations via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a> for implementing <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/qa2c9S88r_o" target="_blank">background services for .NET</a>. Join the conversation if you'd like to contribute, add your suggestions or have any ideas on how this should be implemented.

                    </div>
                    <p>Last weekend, we <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/10/weekend-iron-foundry-work-downtime-window/" target="_blank">did a refresh</a> of the sandbox <a href="http://api.ironfoundry.me/" target="_blank">IronFoundry.ME</a> environment to make sure that it was running the latest Iron Foundry bits. As part of that update, we've enabled and upgraded a few interesting things.

First of all, we added some new services. You can confirm this by using vmc (and don't forget to upgrade your <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/vmc-IronFoundry" target="_blank">vmc-IronFoundry</a> gem!) and executing a <strong>vmc services</strong> command.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182" title="upgrade01" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/upgrade01.png" alt="" width="500" height="266" />

You should notice a few things here. First, MongoDB has been upgraded from version 1.8 to 2.0. Also, we're now running PostgreSQL 9.0. You'll also find the new Cloud Foundry blob service available here.

As far as application runtimes go, we upgraded a couple of those too. You can see this by executing <strong>vmc runtimes</strong> against the IronFoundry.ME environment.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-183" title="upgrade02" src="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/upgrade02.png" alt="" width="500" height="316" />

See that we are running both Java 6 and 7 now. Also, we've upgraded our versions of Node and included support for Node 0.8.2.

Besides upgrading services and runtimes, we also <a href="http://uaa.ironfoundry.me/login" target="_blank">added support</a> for the Cloud Foundry User Account and Authorization Service (UAA). The Cloud Foundry blog has articles that <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/07/23/uaa-intro/" target="_blank">Introduce the UAA</a>, review the<a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/07/24/high-level-features-of-the-uaa/" target="_blank"> high level features of the UAA</a>,  and <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/10/09/oauth-rest/" target="_blank">secure REST web services with the UAA</a>. You'll also find docs on Github that outline the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-Security.md" target="_blank">features and configurations</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-APIs.rst" target="_blank">how to use the UAA APIs</a>. Keep an eye out for an upcoming blog post that shows an example of how you use the UAA service within Iron Foundry.

We hope that you can immediately take advantage of the new capabilities in this free IronFoundry.ME environment.

                    <p>This weekend we'll be doing some upgrades to the instances &amp; software that the current Iron Foundry sand box runs in (api.ironfoundry.me). The time frame of the down time will be between 8pm and 10pm on Sunday night. We'll update this blog post with any additional news that might affect the applications currently running or being tested in the Iron Foundry sand box environment.

Well, have no fear there's no need to! With dilligent work from the Iron Foundry team, a few suggestions from outside, and a few contributions from the community we've pulled this together for you. Here's a step by step of what we've accomplished in the last week to bring a solid, clean and tested library to you.

Presenting the Iron Foundry vcap-client. This library provides all of the capabilities wrapped up in the standard Cloud Foundry vcap-client libraries, except for .NET. Not only did we build out this library to provide a programmatic way for .NET Developers to access and manage Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry environments, we've also provided a Nuget Package for the easiest of access.

With the <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Nuget Package</a> it will handle all of your dependencies. We only have two in the package, but it is always nice to have those just handled for you.

If you'd like to contribute, find any issues let us know, or just want to download the project directly check out our <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-client" target="_blank">Iron Foundry vcap-client Github Repo</a>.
