  <description><![CDATA[
     Today <a href="http://www.activestate.com/" target="_blank">ActiveState</a> released a new version of their Stackato PaaS built on Cloud Foundry. In this new version they've done a spectacular job integrating the Iron Foundry code into the solution, just add a Windows DEA and you're set.

Diane Mueller (<a href="https://twitter.com/pythondj" target="_blank">@pythondj</a>) put together a deep dive using the new <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato Release</a> with .NET Support, check out "<a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2012/07/how-deploy-net-apps-stackato-20" target="_blank">How to Deploy .NET Apps to Stackato 2.0</a>". You no longer need to take the steps <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/03/ironfoundry-and-stackato/" target="_blank">previously written about</a>, instead the integration is now basically plug and play. Stay tuned for more information about this and further Iron Foundry integration work. We've got some good material coming your way.

So check out the release and pick up a copy to test out now. For this release we've been testing with our existing <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Iron Foundry DEA VMs</a>, which are available in two formats: <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">VMware VMX</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">OVF Format</a>.

Let's take a quick tour of Stackato with Iron Foundry. When you boot up the Stackato VM you'll be able to navigate to the Stackato Admin site.

Once launched login with your account and you'll be brought tot the Overview screen. One of the beauties of the Stackato Deploy is this administration interface that they've built at ActiveState. It really eases the way to get a high level overview of what is going on in your PaaS Environment.

When an Iron Foundry DEA VM is added ASP.NET shows up on the runtimes list (awesome!)

[caption id="attachment_71" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2012/07/how-deploy-net-apps-stackato-20" rel="attachment wp-att-71"><img class="size-large wp-image-71 " title="ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI" src="/img/blog/Running-Stackato-w-Iron-Foundry-03-1024x594.jpg" alt="ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI" width="1024" height="594" /></a> ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI[/caption]

At this point you can deploy a .NET application alongside any other application you have in your <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato PaaS</a> Environment using Iron Foundry.

If you have any feedback for Stackato or how Iron Foundry Project should be integrated in or other ideas please <a href="http://help.ironfoundry.org/tickets/new" target="_blank">let us know</a>.

  <title>Iron Foundry, Stackato, a New Micro Image Pair</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/03/27/ironfoundry-and-stackato/</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>

  <description><![CDATA[
     <p class="p1">Today we’re releasing a new update for the Iron Foundry Micro Instance. The biggest changes are two fold. One is our full support of the Stackato from ActiveState powered micro instance. We’ve taken the great work that the ActiveState Team has done with Cloud Foundry and rolled that into our Iron Foundry enabled Micro Instance! The second big addition is full support for the Cloud Foundry <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010689/micro-cloud-foundry-streamlines-offline-support-and-adds-java-debugging" target="_blank">Micro Cloud Foundry 1.2</a> release.</p>
<p class="p1">For those of you that have dived heavily into the overall framework, some of the specifics include changes that enhance the reliability of the controller and self-healing nature of the system.</p>
<p class="p1">How to get it up and running? Easy…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>First download and get the Stackato Micro Cloud Running.</strong></p>

<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Download the Stackato Micro Cloud here: <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm">http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm</a></span></li>
	<li class="li1">Unzip the image to the location you want the image to execute from.</li>
	<li class="li1">Set the network on the staccato image to bridged.</li>
	<li class="li1">Startup the Stackato Image.</li>
	<li class="li1">When it boots up get the IP and Hostname Address. Note both the host name and IP address.</li>
	<li class="li1">The Hostname will need to be added to your hosts file, either /etc/hosts in OS-X or Linux and c:WindowsSystem32Drivershosts. Add the IP &amp; host to the file like ‘192.168.NNN.YYYY <a href="http://stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>’ and  ’<a href="http://api.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">api.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a> <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>‘ (add additional entries at the end for other web apps you intend to push)</li>
	<li class="li1">Navigate to <a href="http://stackato-XXXX.local">http://stackato-XXXX.local</a> and it will redirect to the initial setup page where you enter an email address and password. These credentials are added to the Stackato Instance, so be sure to remember them.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><strong>Next step get the Micro Iron Foundry VM Running &amp; Communicating w/ The Stackato Micro Cloud.</strong></p>

<ol class="ol1">
<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li1">Download the Micro Iron Foundry VM here: <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download">http://www.ironfoundry.org/download</a> (Use 7-zip to unzip, or on the Mac use a tool like the “Unarchiver”(<a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html</a> or get it from the App Store)).</li>
	<li class="li1">If VMWare asks if you have moved or copied the VM, choose “I copied it”.</li>
	<li class="li1">It will show “Setup is starting services” as this is a Windows VM. After it goes through the inital setup it will continue and require your input</li>
	<li class="li1">Set the timezone. Click Next</li>
	<li class="li1">Accept the licensing terms. Click Next</li>
	<li class="li1">It will now say that the users password must be changed before logging on the first time. Click OK and set the password (make sure to remember the password!)</li>
	<li class="li1">After setting the password you will now be logged into the core terminal prompt. You can now enable Iron Foundry on your Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud. (Make sure your Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud is running at the same time)</li>
	<li class="li1">Boot up the Micro Iron Foundry instance. It will prompt you for a password for the Administrator user.</li>
	<li class="li1">At the command prompt (C:UsersAdministrator) execute these commands:</li>
	<li class="li1">C:UsersAdministrator&gt;cd C:IronFoundrySetup</li>
	<li class="li1">C:IronFoundrySetup&gt;RunSetup.cmd</li>
	<li class="li1">At the prompt enter your domain stackato-XXXX.local, IP address and password.</li>
	<li class="li1">It will then connect via ssh, patch the system, restart the cloud controller, and setup the local SQL provisioning services in the Iron Foundry VM.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<img src="http://help.ironfoundry.org/attachments/token/y4khhx10yupemos/?name=image03.png" alt="command line results" />
<p class="p1">Once the setup process is done you can use Cloud Foundry Explorer (<a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download">http://www.ironfoundry.org/download</a>) to push an <a href="http://ASP.NET/"><span class="s1">ASP.NET</span></a> application. I’ve attached a sample <a href="http://ASP.NET/"><span class="s1">ASP.NET</span></a> application. Click the gear icon to add a cloud, click the green + button to add a New Server. Rename server to something and add an api url of <a href="http://api.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">api.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>, email and password. Clicking ”Validate Account” should succeed. Once the cloud is added, you can use push and choose that cloud to publish to it. You should use “testwebapp” as the name since you added it to the hosts file above. Once pushed, you can visit <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local">http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local</a> to browse to your application, and <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/env">http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/env</a> to see more detailed info.</p>
<p class="p1">To get involved with Iron Foundry check out the project at <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org">http://www.ironfoundry.org</a> and Cloud Foundry at <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org/">http://www.cloudfoundry.org/</a>. With the code available on github at <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry">https://github.com/IronFoundry</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry">https://github.com/cloudfoundry</a>.</p>
