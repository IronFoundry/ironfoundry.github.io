  <description><![CDATA[
     A few updates from the teams:
<h2>Thor</h2>
<p>Thor is moving along with implementation of services starting yesterday (Monday). You can view our live <a href="http://huboard.com/IronFoundry/Thor/board" target="_blank">Huboard Kanban</a> to see what is currently being worked on. The interface in the last few weeks has gotten a faster, cleaner appearance and stabilized even more around deploying and maintaining your Cloud Foundry based environments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/"><img src="http://adronhall.smugmug.com/Software/Software-Development/Thor/i-fQFJCBP/0/S/square-S.png" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>If you're an XCode user and familiar with Git, check out the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README.md</a> to pull down the latest code and try it out yourself against your own Cloud Foundry Projects - private or public hosted!</p>

<h2>Thor .NET for Windows Users</h2>
<p>The Windows version of the Thor Client is about to go into beta in the coming weeks. It has an elegant metro style interface and will initially be available for Windows 7.</p>

<p>For the WinRT and Windows 8 versions we're still determining what the best approach is to development of this version of the UI. We'd love any additional input on the WinRT or Windows 8 Applications or how you see you may use the application on WinRT or Windows 8. Let us know in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/bJJucnSx1Vc" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a>.</p>
<h2>vcap-client on Nuget</h2>
<p>Recently we released the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-client" target="_blank">vcap-client library</a> for client usage against any <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> and <a href="http://ironfoundry.org" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a> Built Environments. So if you're a use of the .NET Framework, this library has all the functionality wrapped up in a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">Nuget Package</a> for you.</p>

<p>So if you're a user of <a href="http://www.appfog.com" target="_blank">AppFog</a>, <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com" target="_blank">CloudFoundry.com</a>, <a href="http://www.tier3.com/services/fabric" target="_blank">Tier 3 Web Fabric</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato</a> or another Cloud Foundry enabled environment and write code against the .NET Framework, this is a <a href="http://www.nuget.org/packages/IronFoundry-VcapClient" target="_blank">great library</a> to try out.</p>
<h2>Conversations Around Iron Foundry Library</h2>
<p>We're currently having conversations via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Discussion Group</a> for implementing <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ironfoundry/qa2c9S88r_o" target="_blank">background services for .NET</a>. Join the conversation if you'd like to contribute, add your suggestions or have any ideas on how this should be implemented.</p>

  <title>Contribute to Iron Foundry, Here's How!</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/09/12/contribute-to-iron-foundry/</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>
  <pubDate>2012-09-12T00:00:00-07:00</pubDate>
  <guid>http://realjenius.com/2012/09/12/contribute-to-iron-foundry/</guid>
  <description><![CDATA[
     We've been asked a few times, "<em>what's the quickest, easiest and fastest way to get the code, build it and contribute back to Iron Foundry?</em>" Here's a quick start for doing just that.

First, there are a few prerequisites that you'll need:
<ul>
	<li>Visual Studio 2010 SP1 w/ all the latest patches, updates, etc.</li>
	<li>Get the latest <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa496123.aspx" target="_blank">.NET Framework</a> too.</li>
	<li>You'll also need the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2680" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2010 SDK</a> if you want to edit or compile the Visual Studio extensions.</li>
	<li>Github Account, <a href="https://github.com/login" target="_blank">sign up here</a>.</li>
</ul>
Once these are met, then navigate over to <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> and to the <a href="http://www.github.com/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Repositories</a>. Here at this time you'll find a number of repositories. Here's a short description of each:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry" target="_blank">IronFoundry</a> - this repo is the core Iron Foundry Project Solution. This is where the Windows DEA, the Cloud Explorer (being replaced by the Thor Project) and other projects to extend Cloud Foundry into the Windows world.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/cloud_controller" target="_blank">cloud_controller</a> - this repo is a fork that includes all of the updates from the VMware controlled github repos. We have this here to work on while we sync things up, add and extend and test to send pull requests back to the core Cloud Foundry Project.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-staging" target="_blank">vcap-staging</a> - another fork of the Cloud Foundry Projects for use among the Iron Foundry Project. Updated regularly from upstream.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap" target="_blank">vcap</a> - another fork, same as the others. Updated from upstream.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-services" target="_blank">vcap-services</a> - fork.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/vcap-services-base" target="_blank">vcap-services-base</a> - fork.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/bosh" target="_blank">bosh</a> - fork of the BOSH Project. This project is used for deploying Cloud Foundry &amp; we're working to set it up for use to deploy Iron Foundry bits too.</li>
</ul>
There are a lot of other core repositories and forks, but these are the base ones. The main one you'll want to pull down in order to contribute to is the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Repository</a>.

When you clone the Iron Foundry repo down from Github and open it you'll need to make one setting to make sure everything builds appropriately. We've used Nuget to setup the dependencies and they're pulled down if not available during build time. To make sure that Nuget can do this click on Tools -&gt; Library Package Manager -&gt; Package Manager Settings and in the tree make sure Package Manager has General options displayed. Check the Allow NuGet to download packages during build.

[caption id="attachment_123" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/09/contribute-to-iron-foundry/blurgle/" rel="attachment wp-att-123"><img class="size-large wp-image-123" title="Package Manager Settings" src="/img/blog/blurgle-1024x640.png" alt="Package Manager Settings" width="1024" height="640" /></a> Package Manager Settings[/caption]

Once this is done, select the solution and clean the entire solution. Now click on build or rebuild all, this will now build the entire solution, all the dependencies inline, and pull down any dependencies needed from Nuget.

Over the next few days &amp; weeks we'll take a look at the various Thor Projects &amp; their respective build processes. As always, any comments, questions or otherwise, feel free to let us know in the comments or jump into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">group conversation</a>.

  <description><![CDATA[
     The Iron Foundry project has had an amazing nine months since its launch. Thank you to the entire community for your support and contributions.

With over 3500 downloads and 500 active developers using the free Iron Foundry.ME trial environment, the project has exceeded our expectations.
First, the Iron Foundry team released some powerful tools to support the community including
• Soon after launch we added the NET DEA.
• In February we enabled local development for .NET community with the Micro Iron Foundry
• In April we released the Iron Foundry .ME Environment enabling full Cloud Foundry support + .NET in a free test environment. In addition, we expanded database support to MySQL and Postgres and added support for Rabbit MQ.
• In August we issued an update to the Iron Foundry VMC to keep it in synch with Cloud Foundry.

And, we are very excited not only about the continuing evolution of the available tools, but also the momentum in the industry around Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry adoption. Among the many highlights:
• Intel -- one of the world’s best IT shops -- recently revealed that they are running Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry as their internal environment
• The team at Active announced full Stackato integration with Iron Foundry
• New Zealand’s Appsecute launched their Cloud Foundry application management service with support for managing Iron Foundry applications.

Today we are excited to give you a sneak peak at something special the team has been working on we’ll release to the community in September: Project Thor.

Thor -- and its brother Thor.NET -- is the new client tool for managing your Cloud Foundry and Iron Foundry environments from the desktop.  Thor is the OS-X version and Thor.NET is the Windows version. To grab a sneak peak of the UI and to read our thoughts around design, architecture, and our belief in community for these tools go to <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/thor">http://www.ironfoundry.org/thor</a>.

  <title>Choosing the Right Database Option for Your Iron Foundry Applications</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/08/15/choosing-the-right-database-option-for-your-iron-foundry-applications/</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>

  <description><![CDATA[
     Iron Foundry offers a host of database services that developers can leverage when building Iron Foundry applications. While there may not be a “wrong” choice (although in some cases, there are horribly inefficient choices!), how can we choose the best database for the situation at hand? Below, we look at each database option in Iron Foundry and why you would, or would not, select it for your application.

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h3>MongoDB</h3>

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> is a popular open-source NoSQL database. While called a “document database”, MongoDB does not store unstructured documents like PDFs or Microsoft Word files, but rather, stores its data as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSON" target="_blank">JSON-like files</a>. Each <strong>document</strong> represents a database record while a <strong>collection</strong> is similar to a database table. However, unlike traditional relational databases with a fixed schema, MongoDB collections have no such restriction and each document could have entirely different fields. Developers use the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/SQL+to+Mongo+Mapping+Chart" target="_blank">Mongo Query Language</a> to find records in MongoDB collections. Through the <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Drivers" target="_blank">use of drivers</a>, MongoDB supports a wide variety of languages such as Ruby, Scala, C#, Node, Java and more. MongoDB supports a variety of features (such as <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Replication" target="_blank">replication</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes" target="_blank">indexing</a>) that you’d typically find in RDMS offerings, but also offers unique capabilities such as <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Sharding" target="_blank">auto-sharding</a> and batch processing via <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/MapReduce" target="_blank">MapReduce</a>.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
There’s actually an <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Use+Cases" target="_blank">excellent page on the MongoDB site</a> that outlines the core use cases and anti-patterns. They also have a <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Production+Deployments" target="_blank">useful list of customer stories</a> that explain (sometimes with attachments!) how they are using MongoDB. Basically, MongoDB is a good choice for high performing apps that have complex data objects with a variable schema. Don’t choose MongoDB if you have intense cross-object transactions and heavy SQL coding requirements. While there has been some <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3200683" target="_blank">backlash against MongoDB</a> in the past year, it remains <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/11/mongo_db/" target="_blank">crazy popular</a> for its performance, approachability and lively ecosystem.

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h3>Microsoft SQL Server</h3>

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Server</a> is the flagship database product from Microsoft. It uses a relational structure and is made up of databases, tables and records. The tables in a SQL Server database have a fixed schema made up of typed columns. SQL Server has some of the capabilities that you expect to find in a traditional relational database: stored procedures, indexes, constraints and cross-object transactions. Data is queried through the rich <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-SQL" target="_blank">T-SQL</a> syntax that allows variables, a full set of operations for creating/reading/updating/deleting data, control flow statements and more. Starting with SQL Server 2005, developers can also write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_CLR" target="_blank">stored procedures and triggers based on the .NET language</a>. While SQL Server uses a proprietary data streaming format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabular_Data_Stream" target="_blank">TDS</a>), there are still many ways to access SQL Server data from non-Microsoft clients <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/dataplatforminsider/archive/2011/08/29/microsoft-aligning-with-odbc.aspx" target="_blank">through ODBC</a>. There are also many libraries to make this easier in <a href="https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29995" target="_blank">Node</a>, and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/aa937724.aspx" target="_blank">Java</a>.

While relational databases sometimes get a bad rap for poor scalability, many high volume web sites <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/6/108663-scalable-sql/fulltext" target="_blank">rely heavily on relational databases like SQL Server</a>. SQL Server consistently <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/product-info/benchmarks.aspx" target="_blank">ranks as a leader</a> among relational database providers  in “transactions per second” metrics as calculated by TPC.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
If you have a relatively static data structure and have many objects with inter-relationships, SQL Server is a good choice. Likewise, if you already have an investment in SQL Server tools, then using the Iron Foundry version will be very straightforward. Developers <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/07/web_database_configuration_settings/" target="_blank">can easily use</a> the SQL Server Management Studio against Iron Foundry instances and treat the PaaS database just like one installed locally. Microsoft themselves <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/product-info/case-studies.aspx" target="_blank">tout use cases</a> for internal business applications, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2008-R2-Enterprise/Match.com/Largest-Online-Dating-Service-Gains-Competitive-Edge-with-Microsoft-Solution/710000000118" target="_blank">high volume storage for web applications</a>, and more.

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h3>MySQL</h3>

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, now owned by Oracle, claims to be the most popular open source database and is the “M'” in the ubiquitous LAMP (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP) web stack. It is a relational database that runs on multiple platforms including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Solaris and IBM AIX. MySQL has a wide range of capabilities including support for stored procedures, triggers, database views, indexing, and ACID-compliant transactions. Something that’s unique about MySQL (vs other relational databases) is that it offers <a href="http://www.supportsages.com/blog/2010/08/mysql-storage-engines-an-overview-their-limitations-and-an-attempt-for-comparison/" target="_blank">multiple storage engines</a> that can be used for a given table. Some engines support data types that others do not, and some offer differently levels of support for transactions and indexing. There are engines provided natively, as well as engines created by partners and community members. Queries against MySQL data are performed use SQL that should familiar to anyone who has coded against databases in the past. MySQL offers a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/connector/" target="_blank">series of drivers</a> for client connectivity and there are plenty of other libraries for technologies like <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-db-mysql" target="_blank">Node</a> and <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ruby.html" target="_blank">Ruby</a>.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
Some of the largest web properties in the world <a href="http://www.mysql.com/customers/" target="_blank">rely on MySQL</a> for their data storage. Many of the same reasons that you would use Microsoft SQL Server apply here as well. Structured data, object relationships, and a need for transactions and indexing. Also, if you already have a skills investment in MySQL, then using MySQL for your Iron Foundry application is a no-brainer. The MySQL team has a very nice article on why you’d <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/move_from_microsoft_SQL_Server.html" target="_blank">choose MySQL over Microsoft SQL Server</a>, and Microsoft has the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/product-info/competitor-compare.aspx" target="_blank">same sort of article on their site</a>. You won’t really go wrong with either choice!

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h3>Neo4j</h3>

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<a href="http://neo4j.org/" target="_blank">Neo4j</a> is an open-source, NoSQL graph database. While many of us are familiar with the other types of NoSQL databases (document databases like MongoDB, or key-value stores like Redis), graph databases are a bit more obscure. Graph databases put a high priority on the relationships between objects and makes it easy to query these relationships. In fact, it’s often <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/3/15/graph_databases/" target="_blank">much easier than querying relationships in a relational database</a>! The “things” in a graph database are called a <strong>node</strong>, and the “relationships” are called <strong>edges</strong>. The Neo4j database is Java-based and stores its data on disk. It’s designed to be very fast and also ACID transaction compliant. The database itself can be embedded within an application or deployed as a full-fledged standalone server. While the <a href="http://api.neo4j.org/current/" target="_blank">API</a> places a premium on Java, developers can also access it through an <a href="http://components.neo4j.org/neo4j-server/1.3.M02/rest.html" target="_blank">HTTP/REST interface</a>. Data queries are executed using the <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/cypher-query-lang.html" target="_blank">Cypher Query Language</a> which is designed for efficient traversal of graphs.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
This database will be a great choice for Iron Foundry applications that place a premium on relationships between schema-less data structures. That means that this will be a good fit for social networks, genome analysis, recommendation algorithms <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/graph-nosql-neo4j" target="_blank">and more</a>.

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h3>PostgreSQL</h3>

<hr align="left" width="95%" />

<h4>What is it?</h4>
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a> is an increasingly popular open-source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_database" target="_blank">object-relational</a> database system. You can run PostgreSQL on <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/download/" target="_blank">nearly every operating system</a> including Linux, UNIX, and Windows. It’s a very robust database that is ACID-compliant and has features like joins, views, triggers, stored procedures and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/external-interfaces.html" target="_blank">native programming interfaces</a> for popular languages/frameworks like Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, ODBC and more. PostgreSQL has a lot of sophisticated features such as <a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/gist/doc/intro.shtml" target="_blank">GIST indexing</a>, <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ddl-inherit.html" target="_blank">table inheritance</a>,  and a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/rules.html" target="_blank">rules system</a>. Queries against the structured tables are done using <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/sql.html" target="_blank">SQL</a> and should be easy for any database programmer to use. An <a href="http://wekeroad.com/2012/07/19/postgresql-rising" target="_blank">article about the rise of PostgreSQL</a> generated a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4268525" target="_blank">lengthy discussion on Hacker News</a> where many proponents and detractors of the platform debated the merits and shortfalls of the platform. It’s a good read.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
PostgreSQL has some <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/users/" target="_blank">prominent customers</a> across industries. You’ll <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8181604/postgres-9-1-vs-mysql-5-6-innodb" target="_blank">often</a> <a href="http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2012/04/30/why-postgres/" target="_blank">find</a> PostgreSQL compared to MySQL <a href="http://facility9.com/2011/12/ten-reasons-postgresql-is-better-than-sql-server/" target="_blank">or</a> SQL Server. In essence though, consider choosing PostgreSQL for your Iron Foundry application if you want to use an open-source database for a high-performing (web) application that uses SQL queries. It’s a great fit for complex scenarios that can take advantage of the differentiating features like inheritance and advanced query optimization.

<a href="http://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> is a fast, widely used open-source NoSQL database that uses a key-value store paradigm. Data is typically stored in-memory, although now users can optionally snapshot data to disk periodically. It runs on UNIX/Linux/MacOS (although non-production quality ports for Windows exist). Redis supports a handful of <a href="http://redis.io/topics/data-types" target="_blank">data types</a> including strings, lists (of strings), sets (unordered collections of strings), sorted sets and hashes (which are useful for object representations). While optimized for individual key retrieval, database content can be filtered/searched through operations like <a href="http://redis.io/commands/zrange" target="_blank">ZRANGE</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/commands/lrange" target="_blank">LRANGE</a>,  <a href="http://redis.io/commands/getrange" target="_blank">GETRANGE</a> and <a href="http://redis.io/commands" target="_blank">more</a>. Redis also has some cool features like <a href="http://redis.io/commands/expire" target="_blank">content expiration</a>, and a pub/sub engine that opens up a whole host of <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/6325247416/redis-pub-sub-how-does-it-work" target="_blank">possibilities</a>. There are a variety of data access libraries available for languages/frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis" target="_blank">.NET</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis" target="_blank">Java</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mranney/node_redis" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasff/phpredis" target="_blank">PHP</a> and <a href="http://redis.io/clients" target="_blank">many more</a>.
<h4>When to use it?</h4>
Use Redis with your Iron Foundry application when you want blazing speed and have a data set that can sit comfortably in RAM. You would need to be comfortable with the prospects of losing data in the event of a server failure. Many <a href="http://redis.io/topics/whos-using-redis" target="_blank">large organizations are using Redis</a>, often to provide a high performing <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/69164/does-stack-overflow-use-caching-and-if-so-how/69172#69172" target="_blank">caching layer</a> to their application. You’ll also see everything from  storing session data to creating URL shorteners built with Redis.

  <title>Stackato 2.0 integrates Iron Foundry!</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/07/10/stackato-2-0-integrates-iron-foundry/</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>

  <description><![CDATA[
     Today <a href="http://www.activestate.com/" target="_blank">ActiveState</a> released a new version of their Stackato PaaS built on Cloud Foundry. In this new version they've done a spectacular job integrating the Iron Foundry code into the solution, just add a Windows DEA and you're set.

Diane Mueller (<a href="https://twitter.com/pythondj" target="_blank">@pythondj</a>) put together a deep dive using the new <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato Release</a> with .NET Support, check out "<a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2012/07/how-deploy-net-apps-stackato-20" target="_blank">How to Deploy .NET Apps to Stackato 2.0</a>". You no longer need to take the steps <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/03/ironfoundry-and-stackato/" target="_blank">previously written about</a>, instead the integration is now basically plug and play. Stay tuned for more information about this and further Iron Foundry integration work. We've got some good material coming your way.

So check out the release and pick up a copy to test out now. For this release we've been testing with our existing <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Iron Foundry DEA VMs</a>, which are available in two formats: <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">VMware VMX</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">OVF Format</a>.

Let's take a quick tour of Stackato with Iron Foundry. When you boot up the Stackato VM you'll be able to navigate to the Stackato Admin site.

[caption id="attachment_68" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/07/stackato-2-0-integrates-iron-foundry/stackato-setup-01/" rel="attachment wp-att-68"><img class="size-large wp-image-68" title="Stackato Setup" src="/img/blog/Stackato-Setup-01-1024x377.jpg" alt="Stackato Setup" width="1024" height="377" /></a> Stackato Setup[/caption]

Once launched login with your account and you'll be brought tot the Overview screen. One of the beauties of the Stackato Deploy is this administration interface that they've built at ActiveState. It really eases the way to get a high level overview of what is going on in your PaaS Environment.

[caption id="attachment_69" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/07/stackato-2-0-integrates-iron-foundry/running-stackato-w-iron-foundry-02/" rel="attachment wp-att-69"><img class="size-large wp-image-69" title="The left hand side default logged in display." src="/img/blog/Running-Stackato-w-Iron-Foundry-02-1024x654.jpg" alt="The left hand side default logged in display." width="1024" height="654" /></a> The left hand side default logged in display.[/caption]

When an Iron Foundry DEA VM is added ASP.NET shows up on the runtimes list (awesome!)

[caption id="attachment_71" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://www.activestate.com/blog/2012/07/how-deploy-net-apps-stackato-20" rel="attachment wp-att-71"><img class="size-large wp-image-71 " title="ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI" src="/img/blog/Running-Stackato-w-Iron-Foundry-03-1024x594.jpg" alt="ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI" width="1024" height="594" /></a> ASP.NET 4.0 Available in Stackato UI[/caption]

At this point you can deploy a .NET application alongside any other application you have in your <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato PaaS</a> Environment using Iron Foundry.

If you have any feedback for Stackato or how Iron Foundry Project should be integrated in or other ideas please <a href="http://help.ironfoundry.org/tickets/new" target="_blank">let us know</a>.

  <title>Iron Foundry, Stackato, a New Micro Image Pair</title>
  <link>http://realjenius.com/2012/03/27/ironfoundry-and-stackato/</link>
  <author>R.J. Lorimer</author>

  <description><![CDATA[
     <p class="p1">Today we’re releasing a new update for the Iron Foundry Micro Instance. The biggest changes are two fold. One is our full support of the Stackato from ActiveState powered micro instance. We’ve taken the great work that the ActiveState Team has done with Cloud Foundry and rolled that into our Iron Foundry enabled Micro Instance! The second big addition is full support for the Cloud Foundry <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/post/13481010689/micro-cloud-foundry-streamlines-offline-support-and-adds-java-debugging" target="_blank">Micro Cloud Foundry 1.2</a> release.</p>
<p class="p1">For those of you that have dived heavily into the overall framework, some of the specifics include changes that enhance the reliability of the controller and self-healing nature of the system.</p>
<p class="p1">How to get it up and running? Easy…</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>First download and get the Stackato Micro Cloud Running.</strong></p>

<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li3"><span class="s2">Download the Stackato Micro Cloud here: <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm">http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm</a></span></li>
	<li class="li1">Unzip the image to the location you want the image to execute from.</li>
	<li class="li1">Set the network on the staccato image to bridged.</li>
	<li class="li1">Startup the Stackato Image.</li>
	<li class="li1">When it boots up get the IP and Hostname Address. Note both the host name and IP address.</li>
	<li class="li1">The Hostname will need to be added to your hosts file, either /etc/hosts in OS-X or Linux and c:WindowsSystem32Drivershosts. Add the IP &amp; host to the file like ‘192.168.NNN.YYYY <a href="http://stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>’ and  ’<a href="http://api.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">api.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a> <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>‘ (add additional entries at the end for other web apps you intend to push)</li>
	<li class="li1">Navigate to <a href="http://stackato-XXXX.local">http://stackato-XXXX.local</a> and it will redirect to the initial setup page where you enter an email address and password. These credentials are added to the Stackato Instance, so be sure to remember them.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><strong>Next step get the Micro Iron Foundry VM Running &amp; Communicating w/ The Stackato Micro Cloud.</strong></p>

<ol class="ol1">
<ol class="ol1">
	<li class="li1">Download the Micro Iron Foundry VM here: <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download">http://www.ironfoundry.org/download</a> (Use 7-zip to unzip, or on the Mac use a tool like the “Unarchiver”(<a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html</a> or get it from the App Store)).</li>
	<li class="li1">If VMWare asks if you have moved or copied the VM, choose “I copied it”.</li>
	<li class="li1">It will show “Setup is starting services” as this is a Windows VM. After it goes through the inital setup it will continue and require your input</li>
	<li class="li1">Set the timezone. Click Next</li>
	<li class="li1">Accept the licensing terms. Click Next</li>
	<li class="li1">It will now say that the users password must be changed before logging on the first time. Click OK and set the password (make sure to remember the password!)</li>
	<li class="li1">After setting the password you will now be logged into the core terminal prompt. You can now enable Iron Foundry on your Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud. (Make sure your Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud is running at the same time)</li>
	<li class="li1">Boot up the Micro Iron Foundry instance. It will prompt you for a password for the Administrator user.</li>
	<li class="li1">At the command prompt (C:UsersAdministrator) execute these commands:</li>
	<li class="li1">C:UsersAdministrator&gt;cd C:IronFoundrySetup</li>
	<li class="li1">C:IronFoundrySetup&gt;RunSetup.cmd</li>
	<li class="li1">At the prompt enter your domain stackato-XXXX.local, IP address and password.</li>
	<li class="li1">It will then connect via ssh, patch the system, restart the cloud controller, and setup the local SQL provisioning services in the Iron Foundry VM.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<img src="http://help.ironfoundry.org/attachments/token/y4khhx10yupemos/?name=image03.png" alt="command line results" />
<p class="p1">Once the setup process is done you can use Cloud Foundry Explorer (<a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download">http://www.ironfoundry.org/download</a>) to push an <a href="http://ASP.NET/"><span class="s1">ASP.NET</span></a> application. I’ve attached a sample <a href="http://ASP.NET/"><span class="s1">ASP.NET</span></a> application. Click the gear icon to add a cloud, click the green + button to add a New Server. Rename server to something and add an api url of <a href="http://api.stackato-XXXX.local/"><span class="s1">api.stackato-XXXX.local</span></a>, email and password. Clicking ”Validate Account” should succeed. Once the cloud is added, you can use push and choose that cloud to publish to it. You should use “testwebapp” as the name since you added it to the hosts file above. Once pushed, you can visit <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local">http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local</a> to browse to your application, and <a href="http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/env">http://testwebapp.stackato-XXXX.local/env</a> to see more detailed info.</p>
<p class="p1">To get involved with Iron Foundry check out the project at <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org">http://www.ironfoundry.org</a> and Cloud Foundry at <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org/">http://www.cloudfoundry.org/</a>. With the code available on github at <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry">https://github.com/IronFoundry</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry">https://github.com/cloudfoundry</a>.</p>
