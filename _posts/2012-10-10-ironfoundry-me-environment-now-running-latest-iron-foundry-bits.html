Last weekend, we <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/10/weekend-iron-foundry-work-downtime-window/" target="_blank">did a refresh</a> of the sandbox <a href="http://api.ironfoundry.me/" target="_blank">IronFoundry.ME</a> environment to make sure that it was running the latest Iron Foundry bits. As part of that update, we've enabled and upgraded a few interesting things.

First of all, we added some new services. You can confirm this by using vmc (and don't forget to upgrade your <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/vmc-IronFoundry" target="_blank">vmc-IronFoundry</a> gem!) and executing a <strong>vmc services</strong> command.

You should notice a few things here. First, MongoDB has been upgraded from version 1.8 to 2.0. Also, we're now running PostgreSQL 9.0. You'll also find the new Cloud Foundry blob service available here.

As far as application runtimes go, we upgraded a couple of those too. You can see this by executing <strong>vmc runtimes</strong> against the IronFoundry.ME environment.

See that we are running both Java 6 and 7 now. Also, we've upgraded our versions of Node and included support for Node 0.8.2.

Besides upgrading services and runtimes, we also <a href="http://uaa.ironfoundry.me/login" target="_blank">added support</a> for the Cloud Foundry User Account and Authorization Service (UAA). The Cloud Foundry blog has articles that <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/07/23/uaa-intro/" target="_blank">Introduce the UAA</a>, review the<a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/07/24/high-level-features-of-the-uaa/" target="_blank"> high level features of the UAA</a>,  and <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/10/09/oauth-rest/" target="_blank">secure REST web services with the UAA</a>. You'll also find docs on Github that outline the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-Security.md" target="_blank">features and configurations</a>, as well as <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa/blob/master/docs/UAA-APIs.rst" target="_blank">how to use the UAA APIs</a>. Keep an eye out for an upcoming blog post that shows an example of how you use the UAA service within Iron Foundry.

We hope that you can immediately take advantage of the new capabilities in this free IronFoundry.ME environment.
