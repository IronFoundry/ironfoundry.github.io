<a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">Micro Iron Foundry</a> is a VM image that makes it easy to add the .NET DEA to <a href="https://micro.cloudfoundry.com/" target="_blank">Micro Cloud Foundry</a> development environments. This powerful combination helps developers design their Cloud Foundry solutions locally before pushing to any number of public hosting providers.

Today, we’ve updated the Micro Iron Foundry instance to ensure compatibility with the latest version of Micro Cloud Foundry. Download the VMX or OVF image now and <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/02/iron-foundry-micro-cloud-1-0-0-released/" target="_blank">plug it into your existing Micro Cloud Foundry image</a>. In addition to updating the image to the most recent Cloud Foundry-friendly bits, we’ve also made three other notable changes:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Microsoft .NET 4.5 support.</strong> The latest version of the .NET framework includes a number of cool improvements from Web Sockets support, to better Windows Identity Foundation capabilities, to access to the new ASP.NET Web API. Micro Iron Foundry is running .NET 4.5 and soon you’ll see this support in IronFoundry.ME and other hosting environments.</li>
	<li><strong>DEA compatible with latest ActiveState Stackato. </strong>We’ve ensured that this new Micro Iron Foundry instance works great with the <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato/download_vm" target="_blank">very latest Stackato Micro Cloud</a>. See <a href="http://blog.ironfoundry.org/2012/03/ironfoundry-and-stackato/" target="_blank">our previous blog post</a> on how to connect ActiveState’s great product to a Micro Cloud Foundry + Micro Iron Foundry setup.</li>
	<li><strong>Standard vmc gem works against Iron Foundry applications. </strong>You no longer need to use the vmc-IronFoundry gem in order to push .NET applications to your Iron Foundry DEA in Micro Iron Foundry. Note that you still need this gem when pushing applications to IronFoundry.ME and other Iron Foundry hosting environments.</li>
</ul>
