We will be retiring our IronFoundry Platform-as-a-Service Beta, [beta.ironfoundry.me](http://beta.ironfoundry.me/), on April 15th, 2016.

### Why?

When we started the Iron Foundry project in back 2006, our goal was to provide .NET and [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) developers with the same levels of agility and freedom that Java, Ruby, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Go developers gained from Cloud Foundry.

We [launched](http://www.ironfoundry.org/2011/12/15/whats-next-for-iron-foundry-net-dea-and-vmc-in-the/) the [beta.ironfoundry.me](https://uaa.beta.ironfoundry.me/) platform in 2011 (later evolving into [ironfoundry.me](http://ironfoundry.me/)) as a venue to showcase ASP.NET and .NET apps running on Cloud Foundry, and also to help us understand how to run Cloud Foundry at scale in a hybrid Linux and Windows environment. We learned how to successfully operate and manage a Cloud Foundry service, while simultaneously improving the .NET experience for developers.

The insights and knowledge gained from this experience were [transferred last year](http://www.ironfoundry.org/2015/02/07/Diego-Windows-Update/) when we handed the Iron Foundry project over to the Cloud Foundry foundation. These contributions are now part of the [Windows Diego Garden](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-windows) and [IronFrame](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/IronFrame) projects. This was a major milestone in the evolution of .NET support on Cloud Foundry and we’re happy to have played a part in it.

### What Does this Mean?

Now that the Diego version of Cloud Foundry has been released, the usefulness of beta.ironfoundry.me – now running an older version of Iron Foundry – has ended. It has served its purpose, helping to [drive .NET and Windows support into CF](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/pivotal-cloud-foundry-1-6-technical-blog-new-runtime-services-net-more).

The feedback and insights we’ve gained from our users during this process has been invaluable. We are immeasurably grateful for your contributions and look forward to a future with .NET on Cloud Foundry as part of Diego!
