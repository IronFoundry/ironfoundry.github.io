<p>We’ve heard a great, positive response to the <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/2013/08/10/manage-cloud-foundry-from-osx-with-thor/" target="_blank">release of Thor</a>, and we’ve started work on Thor v2 which will be compliant with Cloud Foundry v2 environments. We’re also getting going on Thor.NET so that Windows developers can also get in on the Cloud Foundry fun.</p>

<p>For Thor v2, we’re going to update the user flow to better reflect the structural changes in Cloud Foundry v2. Specifically, we want to represent the <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/using/managing-apps/orgs-and-spaces.html" target="_blank">Organizations and Spaces</a> in Thor, and make it easy to assign users to roles in both. You’ll be able to add references to multiple clouds, list the spaces in an organization, view the applications within a space, and view the details for a given app. Some of our first UI sketches show off this model.</p>

<p>Adding users and assigning them to roles will be simple.</p>

<p>We’ve already begun doing the formal mockups for the Thor UI (that will look the same for both Thor and Thor.NET) and will be diving into core development shortly.</p>

<p>We’d love to have you contribute to either project! The Thor v2 for OSX project is <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>. The Thor.NET project has a <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET" target="_blank">basic skeleton in GitHub</a> and we’ll be rolling on that shortly. Questions? Feature ideas? Throw something into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry forums</a>.</p>
