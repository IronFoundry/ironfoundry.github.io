<span>The launch of Iron Foundry this week was amazing and we want to send a sincere thanks out to the entire community. As things always do in a community process, we’ve received great suggestions, found a few hiccups, and seen some amazing engagement!  </span>

<span>Today I want to share an update of what’s next – what is launching soon and where we are going longer term:</span>

<strong><span>.NET based DEA and VMC in the next 2 weeks!</span></strong>

<span>Currently we have modified the DEA that is based on Ruby to work on Windows. We always knew this was something that had to change, but we also knew that the Cloud Foundry code base is evolving at a very rapid rate. To keep compatibility we essentially ran two projects with one focusing on using current code base and doing modifications to have it work and the other to completely replace the Ruby code with .NET. </span>

<span>That time has come and we will be releasing that code to the community in the next couple weeks. Over the next couple days we will begin to open the repositories of the BETA .NET DEA and VMC with the goal of a final release with all the fun stuff added in (installers, documentation).</span>

<strong><span>What are the next things you will be working on?</span></strong>

<span>With the releases of the .NET DEA and VMC we turn our attention to adding in services that compliment .NET in the Cloud Foundry Framework such as a session state service, caching service, and other items that enable developers to use Cloud Foundry with all the tools in their tool box they are used too. These services will of course be released under Iron Foundry.</span>

<span>As always, we look forward to feedback from the community on these or any other next steps for Iron Foundry.</span>
