Today, the core team of [Iron Foundry](https://github.com/ironfoundry) is proud to announce the immediate availability of [ironfoundry.me](/), a refreshed and relaunched version of Iron Foundry, now based on [Cloud Foundry V2](http://www.cloudfoundry.oerg). Developers using the new ironfoundry.me site will be able to develop and deploy .Net applications onto a combined Iron Foundry/Cloud Foundry infrastructure, taking advantage of the power of both.

This new version of ironfoundry.me represents a major upgrade in functionality over the original deployment. Many important improvements have been added to both the Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry sides of the infrastructure, the largest being:

* Iron Foundry is fully upgraded to new Cloud Foundry feature set and architecture, enabling it to evolve as Cloud Foundry is evolves,
* An enterprise-usable governance model is available to define and control resources and costs associated with development and deployment,
* Many improvements in reliability, stability, scalability, and supportability that will be critical to organizations deploying Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry together.

These features, together with additional work on the Iron Foundry roadmap, chart an exciting and evolving course through developing a truly enterprise-ready capbility to develop and launch .Net applications on the leading open source Platform as a Service, Cloud Foundry. We invite you to read on through the rest of this post to learn in more detail what the new ironfoundry.me offers, and how you can make use of it.

### What is ironfoundry.me?
ironfoundry.me is a publicly available sandbox for developers to explore and interact with Iron Foundry on top of a fully featured Cloud Foundry V2 installation. It provides the ability for anyone to push .Net applications into Iron Foundry and operate those applications in the same way that they can interact with every other kind of app deployed to Cloud Foundry, whether it be java, node, ruby, golang, or any other development stack. It's quite literally the best of both worlds - the power and expressiveness of .Net, and the ease of use and agility provided by Cloud Foundry. 

### What are the goals for ironfoundry.me?
There are several goals that the Iron Foundry team has for ironfoundry.me. The first of which, obviously, is to provide that sandbox to allow .Net developers to experience the power inherent in Cloud Foundry. We believe very strongly in the Cloud Foundry vision and ecosystem, and we truly want to bring that vision to the .Net world. This is a safe place where .Net developers can come to experiment and learn about how they can leverage the combination of .Net and Cloud Foundry in an enterprise environment. 

The second goal is to help us to learn more about how to support, monitor, and operate Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry. It's one thing to put Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry out there for developers to use - it's an entirely different matter to be able to run and maintain it long term. We want to use ironfoundry.me as our playground to learn how to better operationalize it, so that we can help others do the same. As we learn lessons about doing so, we'll contribute that knowledge back to the community through blog posts and hopefully additional open source repositories.

The final goal to discuss here is that we want to involve you. To do that, we need to provide  an avenue through which to engage with the community and get feedback on the additional features we're going to keep adding to Iron Foundry. We have plans for additional .Net service integrations, improvements to the features and functionality offered by Iron Foundry that will provide better abilities, support for different kinds of .Net and win32 applications, and more. We want input as to what is most important to our users, both as individual developers and as members of a larger enterprise organization. That advice will help us steer our efforts into producing the most highly valued features first, based on our community. We'd also really appreciate additional team members for Iron Foundry, so please feel free to volunteer and contribute to the project in whatever manner you see fit.

### How do I get an account?
The first thing you'll  need to do is to get an account. On our [website](/), there is a link to [Sign Up](http://app.ironfoundry.me/signup) on the top navigation bar. Click that, fill out the form, and you will receive an email from notify@ironfoundry.org within a day, giving you your initial password as well as some instructions. To let us get this out the door more quickly, in the spirit of a Minimal Viable Product, we opted for a manual signup process on our end for now, but automating that is high on our priority list. 

In the email, you'll receive your initial password, along with instructions on how to change it, directions for how to invite collaborators to your new organization so you can do team-based projects, and pointers to where you can [get support and answers to questions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry) you may have about ironfoundry.me, Iron Foundry, and Cloud Foundry.

### How do I get started?
Visit our [Help](/help/) pages to learn about what you can do with Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry. There is a whole section on that page for learning how to [get started with Iron Foundry V2](/help/#if-v2-beta). This is an ever expanding and increasing set of short articles about specific tasks and concepts that should help you get moving initially, and keep moving as you grow more sophisticated. We're adding more entries to this every week, so keep checking back! 

If you have a specific task or concept you'd like to learn about, drop us a note through the support channels, and we'll add that to the list of articles to write. Even better, if you'd like to write an article of your own, let us know and we'll add it to the site.

### Transitioning away from ironfoundry.me Version 1
There are still a number of users of the original ironfoundry.me site, and we don't want to just desert them. What this means for V2 is that we will use a temporary URL of beta.ironfoundry.me for a short time. Over the next two weeks, we will make several attempts to warn users of the existing V1 that a change is coming and that the existing V1 ironfoundry.me will be retired. 

Approximately two weeks from today, we will switch from the temporary URL of beta.ironfoundry.me for ironfoundry.me V2 to the main ironfoundry.me address. This may cause a slight inconvenience to users of beta.ironfoundry.me as we switch domain names, but it's worth the small amount of effort to prevent the original site from abruptly vanishing.

### We want you!
Finally, our biggest goal, as we said above, is to invite .Net developers into the ironfoundry.me sandbox, so that we can help expose them to the power and agility provided by using a Platform as a Service offering like Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry. We see tremendous potential in tools such as these, and we really do want to share our enthusiasm with you.

Please join us by [creating an account](http://app.ironfoundry.me/signup), use ironfoundry.me, take an active role in our [community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry), and help us move this [project](https://github.com/ironfoundry) forward. We would really appreciate it!
