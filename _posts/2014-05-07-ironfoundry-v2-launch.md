On behalf of the [Iron Foundry](https://github.com/ironfoundry) core team, I'm excited to announce the immediate availability of [ironfoundry.me](/). This refreshed and re-launched site is now based on [Cloud Foundry V2](http://www.cloudfoundry.org). Developers using the new ironfoundry.me site will be able to develop and deploy .NET applications onto a combined Iron Foundry/Cloud Foundry infrastructure. This abstracts away more layers of the stack from developers, so you can just focus on writing code.

ironfoundry.me represents a major upgrade with important improvements to both the Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry sides of the infrastructure. Highlights:

* Iron Foundry is fully upgraded to the new Cloud Foundry V2 feature set and architecture, enabling it to easily evolve along with Cloud Foundry;
* An enterprise-ready governance model, so it's easier to define and control resources and costs associated with running your apps in the cloud;
* Enhancements for reliability, stability, scalability, and supportability that make it easier for organizations to run Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry together.

These features, along with the planned Iron Foundry roadmap, give .NET developers in the enterprise a compelling reason to adopt Cloud Foundry, the leading open source Platform as a Service. 

But don't take our word for it - try it for yourself. We invite you to try out the ironfoundry.me sandbox. 

[Create an account](/help/create-accounts.html), use ironfoundry.me, take an active role in our [community](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry), and help us move this [project](https://github.com/ironfoundry) forward. The detailed Q&A below will help you get on your way.

Brian Button,

### What is ironfoundry.me?
ironfoundry.me is a publicly available sandbox for developers to explore and interact with Iron Foundry on top of a full-featured Cloud Foundry V2 installation. Here, anyone can push .NET apps into Iron Foundry. From there, the app can be managed just like any other app deployed to Cloud Foundry. This offers developers the power and expressiveness of .NET and the ease of use and agility of Cloud Foundry. 

### What are the goals for ironfoundry.me?
There are several goals that the Iron Foundry team has for ironfoundry.me. First, we want to reduce the barriers to experimenting with Cloud Foundry. The Cloud Foundry vision and ecosystem is a compelling one, and the .NET community should be a part of it. 

The second goal - we want to learn more on what it takes to support, monitor, and operate Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry. It's one thing to put Iron Foundry and Cloud Foundry out there for developers to use - it's an entirely different matter to be able to run and maintain it over the long term. We want to use ironfoundry.me as a sandbox for us as well, so that we can help others do the same. As we learn along the way, we'll contribute that knowledge back to the community through blog posts and hopefully additional open source repositories.

The final goal? Involving devs like you. We'll continue to engage with the community on the additional features, service integrations, and improvements to the functionality offered by Iron Foundry. This will provide our users with improved capabilities, support for different kinds of .NET and Win32 applications, and more. We want your input on, both as individual developers and as members of a larger enterprise organization, so we can steer our efforts into the most valued features. We'd also really appreciate community contributions for Iron Foundry, so please volunteer and contribute to the project in whatever manner you see fit.

### How do I get an account?
It's easy - on our [website](/), just click the link to [Sign Up](http://app.ironfoundry.org/signup) on the top navigation bar. Fill out the form, and you will receive an email from within a few hours describing how to get started. To let us get this out the door more quickly, in the spirit of a Minimal Viable Product, we opted for a manual signup process on our end for now. Be assured, though, automation of this process that is *really* high on our priority list. 

In the email, you'll receive your initial password, along with instructions on how to log in for the first time and how to change your password, and pointers to where you can [get support and answers to questions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry) you may have about ironfoundry.me, Iron Foundry, and Cloud Foundry.

### How do I get started?
Visit our [Help](/help/) pages and learn how to [get started with Iron Foundry V2](/help/#if-v2). This is an ever expanding and increasing set of short articles about specific tasks and concepts that should help you get moving initially, and keep moving as you grow more sophisticated. We're adding more entries to this every week, so keep checking back! 

If you have a specific task or concept you'd like to learn about, drop us a note through the support channels, and we'll add that to the list of articles to write. Even better, if you'd like to write an article of your own, let us know and we'll add it to the site.

### Transitioning away from ironfoundry.me Version 1
There are still a number of users of the original ironfoundry.me site, and we don't want to just desert them. What this means for V2 is that we will use a temporary URL of beta.ironfoundry.me for a short time. Over the next two weeks, we will make several attempts to warn users of the existing V1 that a change is coming and that the existing V1 ironfoundry.me will be retired. 

Approximately two weeks from today, we will switch from the temporary URL of beta.ironfoundry.me to the main ironfoundry.me address. This may cause a slight inconvenience to users of beta.ironfoundry.me as we switch domain names, but it's worth the small amount of effort to prevent the original site from abruptly vanishing.
