Iron Foundry has been growing in size and one of the items that we want to do is maintain the focus of enabling .NET in the Cloud Foundry ecosystem. To do that we have moved [Thor v2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/Thor) (the OSX client for Cloud Foundry) to [Cloud Foundry Community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community). 

An overview of Thor v2:

<p>Adding users and assigning them to roles will be simple.</p>

<p>We’ve already begun doing the formal mockups for the Thor UI (that will look the same for both Thor and Thor.NET) and will be diving into core development shortly.</p>

We are fully commit at Iron Foundry to work on Thor v2 as we have discussed in our blog. Our goal with this is to have a clean separation of the two projects and focus our work on Iron Foundry to just .NET. Here is a list of high level features that Iron Foundry is planning on offering and supporting:

* .NET Extension to Cloud Foundry
* .NET Library for Cloud Foundry (SDK)
* .NET Support for BOSH
* Visual Studio Extension for Managing Cloud Foundry
* Thor.NET - Windows Client for Managing Cloud Foundry
* Powershell for Cloud Foundry
* SQL Server Integration for Cloud Foundry 


<p>We’d love to have you contribute to any of these projects! The Thor v2 for OSX project is <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/Thor" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>. The Thor.NET project has a <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET" target="_blank">basic skeleton in GitHub</a> and we’ll be rolling on that shortly. Questions? Feature ideas? Throw something into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry forums</a>.</p>
