We had a great time attending the Cloud Foundry Platform Conference and being able to meet so many people in the Cloud Foundry community. Our presentation about extending .NET on Cloud Foundry was well received and many people are already making plans on implementing Iron Foundry v2 into their environments. 

<p>To learn more, check out the slides and video of the presentation.</p>

<p>As always, we’d love to have you contribute to any of these projects! The Thor v2 for OSX project is <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/Thor" target="_blank">here on GitHub</a>. The Thor.NET project has a <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry/Thor.NET" target="_blank">basic skeleton in GitHub</a> and we’ll be rolling on that shortly. Questions? Feature ideas? Throw something into the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ironfoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry forums</a>.</p>
