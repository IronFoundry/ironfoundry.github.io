It was a great event with individuals coming to check out what the Iron Foundry Project enables and also to talk about PaaS Technologies in general.

The meeting kicked off with an introduction from Jared Wray, CTO of Tier 3. After he wrapped up the Iron Foundry Team; Eric Lee (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/saintgimp" target="_blank">@saintgimp</a>), Shantu Roy (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shanturoy" target="_blank">@shanturoy</a>), Luke Bakken (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lukebakken" target="_blank">@lukebakken</a>) and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/adron" target="_blank">@Adron</a>) walked through several demoes involving ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, Node.js, Express.js + NPM Additions, Java, Rabbit MQ, and Ruby with Sinatra.

During the course of the event we were able to show off a lot of the key pieces of the Iron Foundry Project including the Visual Studio Extension, the Cloud Explorer and discussed how the Windows DEA operates within the Cloud Foundry PaaS environment.

<strong>The Future, PaaS</strong>

PaaS is the future and with that we'll be aiming to build and expand on our Pizza and PaaS meetups. They're a lot of fun, informative and we get to push forward the PaaS technologies! So keep an eye out and we'll post future meet ups here on the blog. We're looking forward to meeting you!
