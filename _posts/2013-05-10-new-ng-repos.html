<p>Many of you have asked us what our plans are on <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/docs/roadmap-4-13.html" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry NG</a> and we want to let you know that we are hard working on it full time now with plans to see this ready soon.</p>

<p>If you are checking out the repos on GitHub you will see some new NG repos where we will be working and making some adjustments. These are working repos so please be careful when you use them.</p>

<p>Our current plan next week is to enable a board to keep track of progress.</p>
