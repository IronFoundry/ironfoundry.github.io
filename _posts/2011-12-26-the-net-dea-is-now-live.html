<p class="p1">Our new DEA (Droplet Execution Agent) built using .NET is now fully available from the Iron Foundry team. After an implementation of the DEA in Ruby to run on Windows Server, we found great value in rebuilding the DEA in .NET to run natively on Windows. This will give us great flexibility in expanding the capabilities of the framework deployed to Iron Foundry. The .NET DEA enables a more stable environment and easier deployment scenario. Now the .NET DEA is ready for prime time with all functionality as the original DEA and we are very excited.</p>
<p class="p1">This new DEA comes with a full installer and runs as a windows service on the server. Here are the links to get you using it:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">Download the .NET DEA to install</a></p>
<p class="p1">Iron Foundry has already moved to the .NET DEA in our trial environment and you will notices improvements in the application deployment and stability.</p>
