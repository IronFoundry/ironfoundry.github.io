Over the last few months we've been hard at work getting the Iron Foundry Project started and keeping it moving forward. There has been a great amount of support and more than a few pull requests! Thanks to everyone who has submitted fixes and features. We're looking forward to more features and functionality in the future! While working on the Iron Foundry Project we regularly use other open source tools. One of those tools is Huboard so we have an active kanban board to see where and who is working on what. <a href="http://huboard.com/" target="_blank">Huboard</a> is ridiculously easy to setup.
