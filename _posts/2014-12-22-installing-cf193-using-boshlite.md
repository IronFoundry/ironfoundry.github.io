Recently, one of our team members at [CenturyLink Cloud](http://www.centurylinkcloud.com/), [Marcel Ortiz](https://github.com/mosoto), updated Iron foundry support of [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/) from version [1.7.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/v172) to [1.9.3](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/v193). The following tutorial on installing [Cloud Foundry version 1.9.3](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release/tree/v193) using [BOSH Lite](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite) is the first in a series to help ease installation and use of Iron Foundry. This tutorial is for anyone who would like to deploy their own Cloud Foundry environment. Cloud Foundry is a pre-requisite to using [Iron Foundry](http://www.ironfoundry.org/) in a new environment. All of the steps shown in the video can be followed from the [Iron Foundry release Github repository README](https://github.com/IronFoundry/if_release).
