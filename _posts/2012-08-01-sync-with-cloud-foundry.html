On the Iron Foundry Project we are diligent about keeping up to date with any significant Cloud Foundry changes. With the recent refactoring the Cloud Foundry team has been working there has been a lot more to keep track of. For information on the Cloud Foundry side of things check out these write ups by Mark Lucovsky (<a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/04/27/cloud-foundry-roadmap-below-the-water-line/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry Roadmap: Below the Water Line</a>, <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/05/17/refactoring-the-vcap-repo/" target="_blank">Refactoring the VCAP Repo</a>, and <a href="http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/06/20/heads-up-on-some-new-cloud-controller-features/" target="_blank">Heads Up on Some New Cloud Controller Features</a>).

To check out the changes, with appropriate <a href="http://ironfoundry.org/download" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a> extensions, check out the <a href="https://github.com/IronFoundry" target="_blank">Iron Foundry Repositories</a>. If you'd like to try out your own custom deployment, the scripts have been updated accordingly also.

<strong>VMC CLI</strong>

One of the key things we've done in the last few weeks is change the vmc (<a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.com/tools/vmc/vmc-quick-ref.html" target="_blank">usage information</a>) from preview release to a full release. So to get the latest Iron Foundry enabled vmc be sure to uninstall the previous version:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3231458.js?file=vmc-IronFoundry uninstall"></script>

Then simply use gems to install the latest (<a href="http://help.ironfoundry.org/entries/21783872-managing-applications-from-the-command-line" target="_blank">KB Article Available</a>):
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3231458.js?file=vmc-IronFoundry Install"></script>

If ruby and gems isn't installed on Windows yet follow these quick steps.

Install Ruby for Windows from <a title="Ruby Installer" href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Ruby Installer</a>. This is tested using version 1.9.3. During installation you can either add ruby to your PATH or add it manually later.

Run the following commands from a command prompt. You should ensure that ruby and sqlcmd are in your PATH as well.

Checking ruby version & installing on Windows:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3231458.js?file=vmc-IronFoundry Windows Install"></script>
