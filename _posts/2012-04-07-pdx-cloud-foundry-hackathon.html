If you're in Portland or want to come to Portland for a great day of Pizza, Beer, and <em><strong>DevOp</strong></em>ing come and check out the event. Ok, so I got your attention with the beer and pizza, but what's the hacking really about?

<a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/"><img class="alignleft" src="http://adronhall.smugmug.com/Software/Software-Development/The-CloudFoundry-Story/i-DfwBtVq/0/O/IronFoundry.png" alt="" width="140" height="140" /></a>The event is going to be multi-track with a focus on hacking the <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> (and <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a>) Code base. This track will dive into what is in the code base and how it is put together. The other track will focus on working to deploy and build applications specifically for the Cloud Foundry + Iron Foundry based platforms.

In addition to the main tracks there are a few other workshops we'll be putting on. These include:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/pdx-cloud-foundry-hackathon/sqtqm/" target="_blank">On Premise, Off Premise Cloud Foundry</a> - As quoted on the description "<em>You have internal infrastructure and external infrastructure in this "cloud" thing and would like to utilize both... we'll dive into that.</em>"</li>
	<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/pdx-cloud-foundry-hackathon/sqtqp/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry + Iron Foundry and Bridging the Gaps</a> - "<em>Now we're talking FULL stack across every major stack. Iron Foundry, the missing linq in Cloud Foundry. Adding .NET &amp; having it play nicely with Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and more. We'll also dive into SQL Server, Mongo, and how to make the best use of RDBMS + NoSQL bits. Making the most of the abilities with PaaS.</em>"</li>
	<li><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/pdx-cloud-foundry-hackathon/sqxzb/" target="_blank">The Interoperable Cloud App Gallery</a> - "<em>Ingy döt Net would like to see a huge collection of apps that have been made to work on any PaaS solution. Think of it as the http://rosettacode.org/ of PaaS. Ingy started a GitHub organization called Cloud-Apps that is meant to curate forks of popular apps that have been made to work with one or more PaaS solutions like:  <a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a>, <a href="http://www.activestate.com/stackato" target="_blank">Stackato</a>, <a href="http://www.appfog.com/" target="_blank">AppFog</a>, <a href="http://paas.io/" target="_blank">PaaS.io</a>, <a href="http://www.ironfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Iron Foundry</a>, <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/" target="_blank">OpenShift</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/" target="_blank">DotCloud</a>, etc. He is giving out commit to whomever wants it!</em>"</li>
</ul>
